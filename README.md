## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

These newbie projects are helping me understand basic HTML and CSS fundementals, I want to ensure I have a solid grasp of this before I move onto more advanced topics and leave this a weak area.
This project helped me understand how to center and size different elements as well as positioning elements within each other to match the required design.


### Continued development

I am going to continue to improve my skills in HTML and CSS before moving onto javascript, I feel its important to have a solid understanding of frontend development.


### Useful resources

- [w3schools] https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp - Has everything you need when it comes to HTML and CSS basics
- [MDN] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/- Has a lot of useful and interesting information about the different HTML and CSS tags, I find a new attribute or tag everytime I'm looking for something
